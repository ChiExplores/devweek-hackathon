# Mission Statement:
	We aim to provide ease for government officials to report cases of natural disaster or potential epidemic through an easy document workflow and disastor visualization.

# User Story:
	ex. 1000 flu cases in SF where the city needs medical help and food distribution, so they log on a SPA and select the documents that needs to be signed. This will update the map to show the radial location of affected region.
